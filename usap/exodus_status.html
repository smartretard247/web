  is required.</blockquote>
  <li>Holding Company / HBL Leave</li>

  December 19th. They will go to the holding company and then go on HBL Leave from there. All Departure and Return information
  is required.</blockquote>
  <li>Holding Company / PCS</li>

  and statistics.</blockquote>
  <li>Planned</li>
  <blockquote>All 6 of the Planned statuses should be used when the soldier has a plan to go one of the modes, but does
  not have all of the arrangements made (no ticket, etc). The intent is to get the Unconfirmed Travel Plans to zero and
  get every soldier at least into a Planned status.</blockquote>
  <li>NG/ER PCS Prior to HBL</li>
  <blockquote>National Guard and Army Reserve soldiers who are PCSing prior to HBL. NG/ER soldiers will be allowed to leave
  the day after classes are finished and are not included in the overal HBL plan.</blockquote>
  <li>Other PCS/Chapter Prior to HBL</li>
  <blockquote>This status can be used for a soldier appearing on the HBL roster but will be PCSing prior to the HBL date.
  An example of this would be an Inactive soldier who has everything resolved and is PCSing or a soldier who is receiving a chapter
  and it will be complete before the HBL date.</blockquote>
